# Laravel Standard

This repository hosts documentation for the **Laravel Standard**—shared conventions for building applications with Laravel, Vue 3, and Inertia.js. It contains no application code and exists solely as a reference for our standards.

Agents working on any Laravel project must consult these documents, starting with the [Agents Guide](./docs/agents-guide.md), to ensure they follow the required conventions.

## Guides

- [Agents Guide](./docs/agents-guide.md) – how to apply these standards when contributing to Laravel projects.
- [Laravel Guide](./docs/laravel-guide.md) – backend architecture and coding standards.
- [Vue Guide](./docs/vue-guide.md) – frontend patterns for Vue 3 and Inertia.js.

Always review the relevant guide before committing changes and follow any project-specific `AGENTS.md` instructions.
