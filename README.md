# Laravel Standard

This repository defines the **Laravel Standard**—our shared conventions for building applications with Laravel, Vue 3, and Inertia.js. Consistent structure and coding practices make projects easier to maintain and ensure developers and agents can collaborate effectively.

## Guides

Read the following documents for detailed conventions:

- [Laravel Guide](./laravel-guide.md) – backend architecture and coding standards.
- [Vue Guide](./vue-guide.md) – frontend patterns for Vue 3 and Inertia.js.

All developers and agents are expected to follow these guides when working on Laravel projects.
